# Flagstack Deployer goes brrr

## Introduction

The only purpose of this Chrome extension is to "click" on the green flag to deploy a green flag when you type the shortcut key on the [Flagstack map page](https://www.flagstack.net/map). This makes the workflow a bit easier when you are deploying a lot of green flags on the map.

Note: You need a premium membership to deploy green flags via the website map.

## Installation

git clone this repository to your local disk or download the zip file and extract.

Go to the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions). You'll need to enable developer mode in order to load an unpacked extension.

Click on "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the folder in which you cloned or extracted the source files. Select this folder to load the extension.

## Usage

On the Flagstack map page, hit <kbd>Ctrl-G</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to deploy a green flag on the map.
