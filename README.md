# Flagstack Deployer goes brrr

## Introduction

The purpose of this Chrome extension is to add keyboard shortcuts to help you deploy green flags on the [Flagstack map page](https://www.flagstack.net/map). This makes the workflow a bit easier when you are deploying a lot of green flags on the map.

Note: You need a premium membership to deploy green flags via the website map.

## Installation

git clone this repository to your local disk or download the zip file and extract.

Go to the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions). You'll need to enable developer mode in order to load an unpacked extension.

Click on "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the folder in which you cloned or extracted the source files. Select this folder to load the extension.

## Usage

On the Flagstack map page, hit <kbd>Alt-G</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to initiate the flag deploy.

Move the flag into position.

Finally, hit <kbd>Alt-B</kbd> to "click" on the save button to complete the flag deploy.
